The study aimed to analyze the relationship between emotional intelligence and teamwork among university students. The tests and surveys used, along with the results obtained, are summarized below:

Tests and Scales Used:
Emotional Intelligence Assessment:

Measured four dimensions: emotional awareness, emotional usage, emotional understanding, and emotional controlling.
An 18-item scale was adapted from the original 33-item Schutte Self-Report Inventory (SSRI).
Reliability and validity were tested using statistical software (SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 24.0).
Cronbach's alpha for all variables ranged from 0.776 to 0.888, confirming reliability.
Teamwork Results Assessment:

Measured using a 6-item scale proposed by Volet and Mansfield (2006).
The scale evaluated aspects like timely task completion, calm and control, support among team members, adaptability, and scenario planning.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA):

The model's validity was confirmed with measures like Chi-Square, GFI, CFI, TLI, and RMSEA.
Indicators for convergent validity such as standardized estimates, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and Composite Reliability (CR) were within acceptable ranges.
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):

SEM analysis was used to explore the structural relationships between emotional intelligence and teamwork performance.
The model fit well, with Chi-Square/df, GFI, CFI, TLI, and RMSEA values indicating a good fit.
Surveys Conducted:
The survey was conducted among 372 university students in Vietnam.
Questionnaire Structure:
Part 1: Gathered demographic data (gender, year of study, frequency of teamwork).
Part 2: Assessed emotional intelligence and teamwork performance using a 5-point Likert scale.
Sampling Process:
Universities in Hanoi's economic sector provided lists of students.
60-70 students were randomly selected from each university, and the survey was conducted in person.
Data was collected from July to October 2020.
Results:
The tests confirmed the scales' reliability and validity in measuring emotional intelligence and teamwork performance among university students.
The findings revealed a significant relationship between the dimensions of emotional intelligence and teamwork performance, suggesting emotional intelligence as a predictor of effective teamwork.
This study provides insight into how emotional intelligence influences teamwork, serving as a reference for scholars, managers, and educators to enhance teamwork among students.
