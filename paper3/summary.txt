The introduction of the document discusses the foundational concepts of emotional intelligence, tracing its origins back to early theories of intelligence. It highlights the work of Thorndike (1920), who introduced the idea of "social intelligence," defined as the ability to understand and manage relationships effectively. This concept laid the groundwork for later developments in emotional intelligence.

The introduction also references Howard Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences, which includes intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligence. Intrapersonal intelligence pertains to self-awareness and introspection, while interpersonal intelligence involves understanding others. These two aspects are crucial for the development of emotional intelligence as conceptualized by Salovey and Mayer, who further refined the definition and framework of emotional intelligence in their work from the 1990s .
